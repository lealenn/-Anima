# -Anima

This repository has been created for a website (&Anima). 
&Anima's goal is to compile every knowledge that I acquire and remind me to consult it regularly.
Basicaly it's a learning system. I thought it would be a good thing to add it on gitub.

Do not hesitate to give me advices.
Please just don't forget my programming levels : 
- html/CSS/JS (beginner)
